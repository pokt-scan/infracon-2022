### Work Abstract:
 The Pocket Network is an infrastructure layer which pro- vides Web3 applications with access to cryptographic data structures (blockchains). As such, the health of the network should be analyzed in terms of the served blockchains. Analyzing the statistics behavior of blockchains served by Pocket provides models that show trends and the 
stability of the network. 
By means of statistical time series analysis we fit blockchain history to a series of models which explain their evolution and characterize their behavior. Our study shows that, under the current conditions, the main network chains are actively growing and in good shape in terms of num- ber of relays.
Finally, we intend to show the Pocket community that with a rigorous mathematical foundation we can show that the network is thriving.
